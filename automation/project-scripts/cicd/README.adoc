Here are the scripts for setting up the environment.
Setting also downloads required tools (JDK, Node.js, Npm) in appropriate versions.

Central part is `setenv.sh` that should be "sourced" (evaluated in current shell, not executed):
----
. cicd/setenv.sh
----

Afterwards the environment (shell) is ready, so that `./gradlew`, `node`/`npm`/`ng` and other tools
work as expected for the project.

[NOTE]
Eventual current project-local `jdk-def.sh` and `nodejs-def.sh` files are omitted.

== Using setenv-*.sh to install tool

Specific `setenv-*.sh` script can be used also to install the tool into `$TOOLS_HOME`, if the
definition file for it is prepared beforehand.
For example:
----
. cicd/setenv-java.sh zulujdk-12.0.1
----
