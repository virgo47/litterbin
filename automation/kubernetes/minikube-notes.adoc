= Minikube notes

Minikube is a small single-node kubernetes (k8s) cluster for development/testing purposes.

== Getting started

I tried minikube on Windows which used VirtualBox.
This also provides `kubectl` command on the Windows host, automatically using the minikube cluster.

[source,bash]
----
# First start
minikube start --disk-size 40GB --cpus 4 # default was 20GB, 2 CPU
# After that simply use: minikube stop/start

# Adding support for kubectl top node/pods
minikube addons enable metrics-server
# Wait for the stuff to start, it takes a while, you can check it with:
kubectl get all -A
# or, because "all" does NOT show pods
kubectl get pods -A
# -A is "all namespaces", use -n <ns> for one, otherwise default is shown

# Ingress and DNS support
minikube addons enable ingress
minikube addons enable ingress-dns
