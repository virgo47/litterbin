= Faster setup of new Windows

== Chocolatey

Start with Chocolatey package system - in *administrative* cmd:

----
@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))"
----

All the following commands are with `cmd` syntax (e.g. `"` instead of `'`).
By default, Chocolatey downloads into TEMP directory, which results in repeated downloads, when
you experiment a lot with the same package.
You may point it to a specific directory like this:

----
choco config set cacheLocation "c:\ProgramData\Chocolatey\tmp-cache"
----
Also https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/How-To-Change-Cache[see here].
As a result you have to take care of the directory and maybe clean it up sometimes.
You can also pack this cache directory and move it elsewhere to do offline installation.
(!) TODO: check how this works, because http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18528919/how-to-install-chocolatey-packages-offline[there is more to it].

To allow packages without checksums (avoiding prompt every time):

----
choco feature enable -n allowEmptyChecksums
----

To find out what is installed using Chocolatey, use `choco list -l` or shortcut `clist -l`.
Without `-l` it prints all available packages.
Using `clist -li` prints also applications that are not installed using Chocolatey, but could have been.
To upgrade all installed tools later we just use `cup -y all` (`all` is a special package keyword).

== Chocolatey packages

We can install and download virtually any other favourite tool:

[NOTE]
Sometimes `cinst` doesn't work as expected, e.g. it reports dependency resolution problems, etc.
It's better to wait a couple of hours (or days if possible), to let this problem go away, it's often
nonessential and transitory (yet annoying).

----
choco install -y classic-shell

----
Classic Shell set to Aero, small icons.
OBS Studio is screen capturing software.

Developer's tools mandatory:

----
choco install -y git
choco install -y ConEmu
choco install -y putty
choco install -y winscp
choco install -y 7zip.commandline
choco install -y unzip
REM choco install -y vim # don't need gvim and vim comes with git
choco install -y tortoisesvn

choco install -y vscodium
----

Other tools for virtualization and other experiments:

----
choco install -y virtualbox
choco install -y vagrant
choco install -y packer
----

Greenshot, first https://superuser.com/a/1239937[disable PrintScreen key in OneDrive] (just press
`PrtSc` and say "No..."):

----
choco install -y greenshot
----

Programming (`ghc` is haskell), in order of general usefulness (`python3` provides `pip`):

----
choco install -y python3
choco install -y ruby
choco install -y StrawberryPerl
choco install -y ghc
----

With Python 3 (and PIP) we can install HTTPie.
This can be done in non-admin shell too, but why not to provide it for everyone.
To avoid the need to reopen the console, we call `refreshenv` first:

----
refreshenv
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools httpie
----

If there are problems with Windows permissions, we may do it just for the user adding `--user`
switch, but then we need to add local scripts to `PATH`.
These are typically in `%APPDATA%\Python\Python38\Scripts` or similar.

The rest (back in admin `cmd`):

----
choco install -y processhacker
choco install -y gpg4win-light
choco install -y openvpn-connect
choco install -y licecap
choco install -y nodejs-lts

REM instal WinPcap in advance manually, seems the chocolatey package is broken
choco install -y wireshark
----

We can install various GnuWin32 packages:

----
choco install -y gnuwin32-coreutils.install
choco install -y gnuwin32-grep.install
choco install -y gnuwin32-sed.install
----

*But instead* we can use existing Git and add `c:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin` and
`c:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\bin` to the `PATH` (especially the first one).

== Installing fonts

Source * Pro fonts by Adobe and many others can now be downloaded from https://fonts.google.com.
The following bash snippet downloads all the fonts of interest and unpacks them.
Execute in some temporary directory:

----
wget -q https://fonts.google.com/download?family=Poppins -O poppins.zip
wget -q https://fonts.google.com/download?family=Raleway -O raleway.zip
wget -q https://fonts.google.com/download?family=Josefin%20Sans -O jozefin-sans.zip
wget -q https://fonts.google.com/download?family=Open%20Sans -O open-sans.zip
wget -q https://fonts.google.com/download?family=Source%20Sans%20Pro -O source-sans-pro.zip
wget -q https://fonts.google.com/download?family=Source%20Serif%20Pro -O source-serif-pro.zip
wget -q https://fonts.google.com/download?family=Source%20Code%20Pro -O source-code-pro.zip
for i in *.zip; do unzip -qo $i; done
----

After that open `TTF` folder, select `*.ttf` files, right-click, install fonts.
Some fonts are "variable" and their "static" counterparts are in sub-folders which can be omitted.

=== Trick with GitHub SVN export

While not useful for fonts if the script above is used this is a neat trick on its own.
SVN can download subdirectory of GitHub project (`--force` needed if directory exists).
Go to some temporary/download directory and:

----
svn export https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro/branches/release/TTF
svn export --force https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-serif-pro/branches/release/TTF
svn export --force https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/branches/release/TTF
----

After that open `TTF` folder, select all, right-click, install fonts.

== More Windows settings

=== Wallpapers and logon screen

* Right-click on the desktop , Personalize
* *Background* section, *Background* select to *Slideshow* and choose the directory with my wallpapers (perhaps directly from OneDrive?)
* *Lock screen* section, choose a picture and check *Show lock screen background picture on the sign-in screen*.
* *Colors* section, switch off *Transparency effects*.

=== Disable snap assist, autocorrect...

* *Settings* (`Win+I`), *System*, *Multitasking* section, toggle off *When I snap a window...*

* *Settings* (`Win+I`), *Devices*, *Typing* section, toggle off both *Autocorrect/Highlight misspelled...*
(This should, but does not help with Skype autocorrect, not even in versions that don't have other
options to turn it off.
Still better to have it off.)

=== Firefox setup

Most things can be set from `about:config` URL (see parentheses, valid for Firefox 65):

* Toolbar right-click, Customize... add search bar (`browser.search.widget.inNavBar = true`)
* Options:
** Ask to save logins and passwords for websites OFF (`signon.rememberSignons = false`)
** Show search suggestions in address bar results OFF (`browser.urlbar.suggest.searches = false`)
** Restore previous session (`browser.startup.page = 3`)
** Remove Reader view from address bar (`reader.parse-on-load.enabled = false`)
** Disable Firefox automatic start-up (`toolkit.winRegisterApplicationRestart = false`)
* More about:config (NTLM/Windows SSO + certificates):
** `security.enterprise_roots.enabled = true`
** `network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris = company.com,hostnames-without-domain`
** `network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris = ...`


== ConEmu settings and tips

Best thing is to export settings from previous computer and import XML on the new one.

What I typically change:

* Go to Settings `Win+Alt+P`
* In *General*:
** *Choose your startup task...* select - for me it's *Git bash*.
* In *Keys & Macro*:
** Global hotkey for *Minimize/Restore* `` Ctrl+` `` collides with IDEA, change to `<None>`
(choose nothing from the first select after *Choose hotkey* input).
I'll use `Win+number` for ConEmu anyway.
** Switch to previous/next console change to `Alt+Left/Right`
** Open new console popup is `Win+N` (good)
** Scroll buffer one page up/down - change to `Shift+PgUp/Dn` (`Ctrl` by default)
** In *Keyboard* subscreen uncheck *Win+Number - activate console*.
* In *Features* check *Inject ConEmuHk* to support colors in shells properly.
* Settings XML can be placed next to `conemu.exe` and will be loaded instead of registry.
* Set it as default term (even if we run `cmd` from Start it will use ConEmu).
Go to *Integration*, *Default term* and check first checkboxes (Force..., Register..., Leave in TSA).
To support `cmd` in ConEmu from Total Commander as well, change the list of hooked executables to:
`explorer.exe|totalcmd.exe` (add more at will).
* In *Startup*/*Tasks*:
** Choose your favourite task (e.g. *Git bash*) and set it as default for new console,
and/or set some *Hotkey* for it (e.g. `Alt+B`).


=== Problem - refresh of environment variables

Because any terminal window is attached to the existing ConEmu, not even `Win`, `cmd`, *Enter*
will create a command line with current environment variables after change. We have to close all
existing console tabs first, restart the ConEmu completely and then see the result.

To try it we can start `ConEmu64.exe -nosingle` which forces new window and process. After that
all the new consoles open there and the old ones can be closed at our leisure.

== Various Windows tips/problems

=== Windows Defender folder exclusions

For I/O heavy folders (programming, video, photo) it's possible to turn off Windows Defender.

* *Settings* (`Win+I`), *Update & Security*, *Windows Security* (opens new window),
*Virus & threat protection* on the left, link *Manage settings* in the right section,
then scroll down to *Exclusions*, link *Add or remove exclusions* and add directories like:
** `~/.IntelliJIdea2019.3/system` (Idea asks about it and fixes it anyway)
** `~/.m2` because of massive library caches
** `~/.gradle` ditto
** `/c/work/workspace` programming projects
** `/c/work/video-projects` etc.

In theory the whole `/c/work` could be added, but with binaries under `/c/work/tools` it's perhaps
not a good idea.

=== Setting PATH and other environment variables permanently

`SETX` is the command that should handle it, `/M` tells it to use system environment, not local one.

----
SETX /M JAVA_HOME "c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_92"
----

TODO: Is it possible ot use other variable in PATH? How to display unexpanded variable string?

=== Problem: Blurry fonts on dual monitor or in some applications

Set both monitors to the same size of font (typically it is 125% on the notebook and 100% on
external monitor, 125% is rather too much for the monitor, so 100% is better for both).

=== Problem: `Ctrl+Alt+F8` resets monitors

This combo also collides with IDEA. It's used by *Intel HD Graphics Control Panel Service* and
cannot be disabled (unlike other shortcuts of that service). The whole service can be disabled
as http://stackoverflow.com/a/35109007/658826[described here].

=== Git Bash Here in Total Commander

Better yet is to copy `usercmd/wincmd.ini` from old computer/backup to a new one.

Based on https://virgo47.wordpress.com/2013/05/05/git-bash-here-in-console2-in-total-commander-with-keyboard-shortcut-hotkey/[my blog]
where it is for Console2 - this time for ConEmu.
Setup for user command in Total Commander is (as found in `AppData\Roaming\GHISLER\usercmd.ini`):

----
[em_git_bash_here]
button=C:\Program Files\Git\git-bash.exe
cmd=""C:\Program Files\ConEmu\ConEmu64.exe""
param=""{Git bash}""
menu=Git Bash Here
----

This counts on existing ConEmu task called "Git bash", so I recommend setting tasks first.

Then also add this to `wincmd.ini`
in the same directory as `usercmd.ini` (both `Alt+B` and `Ctrl+B` launch Git Bash):

----
[Shortcuts]
C+B=em_git_bash_here
A+B=em_git_bash_here
----
