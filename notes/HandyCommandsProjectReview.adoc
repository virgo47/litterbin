= Handy commands

== Overall health

=== List of files with last Git modification date:

```
git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD | while read filename; do
  echo "$(git log --date=iso-local -1 --form at="%at %ai %an" -- "$filename") $filename"
done > last-changes.log
```

Then we can sort it:

```
sort -n last-changes.log | head
```

[NOTE]
Using `xargs` seems complicated, we need to use the same argument (`filename` in the example)
twice which requires `-I` which disables `-n 1` (one argument per command).
Using `while read` solves this problem.
