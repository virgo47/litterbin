# Setup of my server


## "Metal"

AWS AMI server. 


## NGINX with PHP

I probably used something [like this](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/installing-nginx-with-php7-fpm-and-mysql-on-ubuntu-16.04-lts-lemp/)
and combined it with AMI specific instructions (Google it).
[This Gist](https://gist.github.com/nrollr/56e933e6040820aae84f82621be16670) also seems interesting.

To remove `X-Powered-By` header with PHP version edit `/etc/php-7.0.ini`, search for
`expose_php = On` and set it to `Off`. Restart of `php-fpm` is required (maybe `nginx` as well).

Removing NGINX's `Server` header seems to be more tricky, but if removing the version number is
enough we can add `server_tokens off;` to `http` section of our `nginx.conf` (and restart the
service).


## HTTPS setup

Tutorials:
* Very good presentation of HTTPS basics: https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-https-101-ssl-basics-getting-started/
* HTTPS setup on NGINX: http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html


### First with self-signed cert

Let's try to setup HTTPS first before we try to get some trusted certificate.

```
sudo -i
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigne d.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
```

Most answers are irrelevant for now, common name should be `virgo47.com` (or `www.virgo47.com`)
but with self-signed we will have browser warning anyway.

Next edit `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` and enable TLS:

```
    server {
        listen       443 ssl;
        listen       [::]:443 ssl;
        server_name  virgo47.com;
        root         /home/ec2-user/virgo;

        ssl_certificate "/root/nginx-selfsigned.crt";
        ssl_certificate_key "/root/nginx-selfsigned.key";
        include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf;

        location / {
        }

        location /tmp {
                autoindex on;
        }

        error_page 404 /404.html;
            location = /40x.html {
        }

        error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
            location = /50x.html {
        }
    }
```

SSL works. Somehow. If browser can't get there (to https) at all we forgot to allow HTTPS (port 443)
in our Lightsail console, Firewall section.

I also generated my own `dhparams.pem` as recommended in the `nginx.conf` and enabled the line.


### Proper certificate

I wanted free trusted certificate, I chose
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/).

There are couple of tutorials for AWS EC2 and Certbot, often about Lightsail and Let's Encrypt in
particular (but not always working for current versions, rather used as an inspiration):
* http://www.alondiamant.com/2016-12-20-using-lets-encrypt-certificates-with-wordpress-on-amazon-lightsail
* https://coderwall.com/p/e7gzbq/https-with-certbot-for-nginx-on-amazon-linux
* https://nouveauframework.org/blog/installing-letsencrypts-free-ssl-amazon-linux/


#### What actually worked after problems with zope module

After reading comments in [this issue](https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/2872) I found

```
pip install pip --upgrade
pip install virtualenv --upgrade
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python27 venv27
. venv27/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt
cd letsencrypt
# Nginx MUST be down for this
./letsencrypt-auto certonly --debug --standalone -d virgo47.com
```

This worked without problem:
```
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/virgo47.com/fullchain.pem. Your cert will
   expire on 2017-09-15. To obtain a new or tweaked version of this
   certificate in the future, simply run letsencrypt-auto again. To
   non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
   "letsencrypt-auto renew"
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
 - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

   Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
   Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le
```

Certificate is valid [only for 90 days](https://letsencrypt.org/2015/11/09/why-90-days.html)
though so we want to automate the renewal process (lower).

Content of `/etc/letsencrypt/live/virgo47.com/` directory:
```
cert.pem  chain.pem  fullchain.pem  privkey.pem  README
```

`README` shortly explains that `fullchain.pem` should probably used, not `cert.pem`. More
thorough documentation is [here](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#where-are-my-certificates).

This changes our lines in `nginx.conf` as so:
```
        ssl_certificate "/etc/letsencrypt/live/virgo47.com/fullchain.pem";
        ssl_certificate_key "/etc/letsencrypt/live/virgo47.com/privkey.pem";
```

Because Let's Encrypt does NOT offer wildcard certificates we need to repeat the process
for `www.virgo47.com` as well and set another server sections in `nginx.conf` for it
with different `server_name` and different paths to key and certificate. Not a big deal
(except for the duplication :-)).


#### Non-working standard process

I tried this one first, but I ended up with:

```
sudo -i
mkdir tmp
cd tmp
wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
chmod a+x certbot-auto
./certbot-auto --nginx
```

Now the last command should help with NGINX support, but for Lightsail server it said:

```
FATAL: Amazon Linux support is very experimental at present...
if you would like to work on improving it, please ensure you have backups
and then run this script again with the --debug flag!
Alternatively, you can install OS dependencies yourself and run this script
again with --no-bootstrap.
```

So for certbot documentaion I chose *I'm using* **None of the above** *on* **Other UNIX**
which leads here: https://certbot.eff.org/#pip-other

But even with `./certbot-auto certonly` it still complaints. We can try to add `--debug` which
installs some new packages (ptyhon27, etc.) but the command fails afterwards anyway:

```
# ./certbot-auto certonly --standalne --debug -d virgo47.com -n
Error: couldn't get currently installed version for /root/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/root/.local/share/letsencrypt/bin/letsencrypt", line 7, in <module>
    from certbot.main import main
  File "/root/.local/share/letsencrypt/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/certbot/main.py", line 7, in <module>
    import zope.component
  File "/root/.local/share/letsencrypt/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/zope/component/__init__.py", line 16, in <module>
    from zope.interface import Interface
ImportError: No module named interface
```

See the process above with virtualenv.


#### Renewal script

Renewing is pretty straightforward. Using `letsencrypt-auto`:

```
~/letsencrypt/letsencrypt-auto renew --pre-hook "service nginx stop" --post-hook "service nginx start"
```

As described in the [certbot docs](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewing-certificates)
When it does not need to renew it will try to renew all known certificates but it will not renew
unless 30 days before expiration.

This does not require `virtualenv` (tested with successful renewal) so the script can just
contain the single line. I added some "logging", put it directly into root's home
and named it `renew-certs.sh`):

```
#!/bin/sh

~/letsencrypt/letsencrypt-auto renew \
  --pre-hook "service nginx stop" \
  --post-hook "service nginx start" &> \
  ~/renewal-`date +%FT%T`.log
```

Set the executable flag and setup the crontab:

```
cd
chmod 700 renew-certs.sh
(crontab -l; echo "47 0 * * * ~/renew-certs.sh") | crontab -
```

Later check whether some log files appear in root's home directory. Weekly period (e.g.
`47 0 * * 0` for Sunday) is possible when we feel confident. :-)


### Checking configuration

We can see in the browser that it works and what certification authority issued the certificate.
But we can also use `curl` to test the connection with various SSL protocols as we don't want
to support all the versions anyway.

```
curl --head -vi https://virgo47.com
```

This shows that by default TLSv1.2 is selected and also displays something about the certificate:
```
* SSL connection using TLSv1.2 / ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
* ALPN, server did not agree to a protocol
* Server certificate:
*        subject: CN=virgo47.com
*        start date: Jun 17 06:56:00 2017 GMT
*        expire date: Sep 15 06:56:00 2017 GMT
*        subjectAltName: virgo47.com matched
*        issuer: C=US; O=Let's Encrypt; CN=Let's Encrypt Authority X3
*        SSL certificate verify ok.
```

We can enforce other version of TLS/SSL like so:

```
curl --sslv2 --head -vi https://virgo47.com
...
* SSLv2 (OUT), , Client hello (1):
* Unknown SSL protocol error in connection to virgo47.com:443
* Closing connection 0
curl: (35) Unknown SSL protocol error in connection to virgo47.com:443
```

Using `--ssl` means to enable SSL/TLS in general, we can choose concrete version with `--sslv2`
or `--sslv3`. By default both are refused. We can also see that TLS is supported including
version 1.0:

```
curl --tlsv1.0 --head -vi https://virgo47.com
...
* SSL connection using TLSv1.0 / ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA
...
```

Using `--tlsv1` will negotiate any TLSv1.x, preferring 1.2, of course.

Supporting anything from TLS 1.0 higher is OK, 1.2 only would be a bit harsh for our purpose.

We can also test various cipher suits with `curl --ciphers ...`.


### OCSP Stapling

[OCSP Stapling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling) (or also [here](https://www.keycdn.com/support/ocsp-stapling/))
makes the TLS negotiation faster. It requires the following changes in HTTPS `server` sections:
```
server {
...
        ssl_stapling on;
        ssl_stapling_verify on;
        ssl_trusted_certificate "/etc/letsencrypt/live/www.virgo47.com/chain.pem";
        resolver 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4;
```

We can test it with:
```
openssl s_client -connect www.virgo47.com:443 -tls1 -tlsextdebug -status
```

After server restart it may first say:
```
OCSP response: no response sent
```

But it [should work the next time](https://www.vlent.nl/weblog/2014/04/19/ocsp-stapling-in-nginx/).

I also experimented with OCSP Stapling enabled in section for `www.virgo47.com` but not in the
`virgo47.com` one. That seemed to not work consistently, not even for requests to `www` virtual
server. I made it consistent as planned.


### HTTP/2

Setting [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) should be easy in the config - adding
`http2` into `listen` directives will do:
```
    server {
        listen       443 ssl http2;
        listen       [::]:443 ssl http2;
...
```

After restart it still seems not to working in browsers, but it works with
[HTTP/2 test](https://tools.keycdn.com/http2-test). However, this test also says that
[ANLP is not supported](https://serverfault.com/questions/831534/why-is-alpn-not-supported-by-my-server).
What does that mean?

[ALNP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-Layer_Protocol_Negotiation) is used by browsers
to upgrade to HTTP/2 -- and that's why it does not work in them. The reason is that at the time
of writing NGINX Amazon Linux is built with OpenSSL 1.0.1 which does not support ANLP. **Good news!
As of Oct 2017 AMI Linux has OpenSSL 1.1 and ALNP works and browsers report HTTP/2.0!** 

To some [this is a big issue](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=752725) (requires
login), I'll probably just wait for the support as I don't require HTTP/2 yet.


### Testing with SSL Labs

Try this: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=virgo47.com&latest

This is a thorough test and will report a lot of various facts and issues. After my rating
was lowered to A- because of [Forward secrecy](https://blog.qualys.com/ssllabs/2013/06/25/ssl-labs-deploying-forward-secrecy)
I also added/enabled the following lines in both my secured `server` sections:
```
        ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
        ssl_ciphers ECDH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:ECDH+AES128:DHE+AES128:!ADH:!AECDH:!MD5;
```

These were also recommended in other articles and the rating went to A (100/95/90/90).

Now to get to 100 on protocol, I guess I need to fix
[DNS CAA: No](https://blog.qualys.com/ssllabs/2017/03/13/caa-mandated-by-cabrowser-forum) warning.
Currently I can't because it's not [Let's Encrypt's business](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/caa/)
but one of my DNS provider - and [Namecheap does not support CAA
entries](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/535/51/what-type-of-dns-records-can-i-manage)
(at least not yet, it's planned with no ETA).

Futher ways how to improve Key Exchange and Cipher Strength is probably to drop TLS 1.0/1.1, but
this would unnecessarily lower the accessability of the page (not that it matters, there is still
plain HTTP).
