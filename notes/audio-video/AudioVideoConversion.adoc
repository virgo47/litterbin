= Audio and video conversions

== First - the aliases

----
alias ff='ffmpeg -hide_banner'
alias exif='exiftool.exe -G1:2 -s -a'
----

FFmpeg and exiftool can be installed with `cinst -y imagemagick exiftool`.
Meaning of exiftool switches is this:

* `-G1:2` shows group names for each tag, family number 1 means *specific
location* and 2 is *category*;
* `-s` printed tag names have no spaces and can be used as options;
* `-a` shows all the tags, even duplicated ones.

See more about exiftool https://exiftool.org/exiftool_pod.html[options]
or https://exiftool.org/faq.html[FAQ]

== Quick overview of video metadata

To quickly see FPS and lenses used for videos during the day use:
----
exiftool -q -s2 -videoframerate -lensid *MVI* | sort -u
----

Option `-q` suppresses output of file names, `-s2` makes the output more compact
and `sort -u` sorts the output leaving each unique line only once.

== Fixing videos for Vegas/Movie Studio

Some MP4 videos (e.g. from Moto C Plus) can't be imported directly (different codec),
but just reconverting them is enough:

----
ff -i XY.mp4 out.mp4
----

Vegas can now import it and the file also gets considerably shorter without visible loss of quality.
At least for that phone (results probably may vary).
Alternatively, use the conversion script below, potentially with `Q=...` prefix.

== Canon video conversion

Videos from Canon EOS 200D can be recoded by `ffmpeg` to much smaller files without perceivable quality loss.
Usage of `ffmpeg` is complemented with `exiftool` to preserve the important metadata (creation date, camera and lens).
The following script does the job:

.canon-video-conver.sh
----
#!/bin/bash
#
# Can handle *.MOV timelapses too, but I don't recommend to recode that one if freezed frames are important.
# For timelapses with stable/slow camera, don't change the quality, it will be compressed nicely.
# For timelapses with dynamic/shaky camera call the script with TQ set to 25 like this:
#  TQ=25 canon-video-conver.sh <params>
# Works for Q as well (for normal MP4 originals).
# Dark/grainy/noisy videos can be nearly as big as originals, they can profit from Q=20 or even 23.

set -eu

# Setting default quality for MP4 and MOV-timelapses, it will be used as CRF parameter.
# 23 is default CRF for ffmpeg, for 1080p/60fps it goes way below 10Mbps (Canon 200D original has 60Mbps).
# 17 is around 20Mbps, it also wildly depends on the style of the video (static/slow is compressed better).
: "${Q:="17"}"
: "${TQ:="17"}"

for FIN in "$@"; do
  SUF="${FIN##*.}"
  SUFL="${SUF,,}"
  FOLD="${FIN%.*}_orig.${SUFL}" # makes MP4 lowercase, so *.MP4 will not cover it anymore
  FNEW="${FIN%.*}.mp4"
  case "$SUFL" in
    mp4|mov)
      # OK
      ;;
    *)
      echo "ERROR: $FIN"
      echo "Not a supported type - you don't want me to mess with random files, do you?"
      exit 1
  esac

  CRF="$Q"
  [[ "${SUFL}" = "mov" ]] && CRF="$TQ"

  # we don't want to overwrite here, script fails if _orig file exists
  mv -n "${FIN}" "${FOLD}"

  # Use FNEW from now on, FIN would not work properly for *.MOVs
  ffmpeg.exe -hide_banner -i "${FOLD}" -crf $CRF -c:a copy -c:s copy "${FNEW}"
  exiftool -overwrite_original -TagsFromFile "${FOLD}" "${FNEW}"
done
----

Some unimportant metadata is lost, but camera/lens info is preserved (see "how-to" section below).
Some metadata can be related to the original video and strictly speaking invalid, I'm OK with that.
Compression is typically 2-3x for MP4 videos and varying for MOV timelapses.
`Q/TQ` is not the `quality` reported during transcoding, there is some offset.
In any case it is used as `crf` argument and lower is better quality (bigger file)
with 23 being default for `ffmpeg` which is much lower quality than original files from Canon EOS 200D.

[NOTE]
Script is useful also for other sources like DJI drone (that's why subtitles are copied with `-c:s copy`)
or videos from the phone/tablet.

Original files are preserved as `*_orig.*`, the extension is lower-cased not to be affected by repeated:

----
# if bash is used, it skips lowercase mp4
canon-video-conver.sh *.MP4
----

If everything is OK, they can be deleted.
If the compression is low (e.g. noisy videos tend to compress badly) or quality needs to be adjusted, they can still be used.

=== Video conversion with metadata how-to

NOTE: No quality settings are used in the examples below.
Add those and other settings as necessary in real-life scenario.
You may skip to the next section where the suitable solution is used.

Naive conversion, `exiftool` is used only for metadata reading for later comparison:

----
exiftool.exe MVI_0059.MP4 > exif-orig.txt
ffmpeg.exe -i MVI_0059.MP4 out.mp4
exiftool.exe out.mp4 > exif-ff-out-default.txt
----

* File `exif-orig.txt` has tons of metadata, creation date, camera/lens info, etc.
* `exif-ff-out-default.txt` does not even have information about creation date (shows creation of `out.mp4` instead).

Experiment based on https://video.stackexchange.com/a/26076[this answer]:

----
ffmpeg.exe -i MVI_0059.MP4 -movflags use_metadata_tags out-movflags.mp4
exiftool.exe out-movflags.mp4 > exif-ff-out-movflags.txt
----

* `exif-ff-out-movflags.txt` is barely different from `exif-ff-out-default.txt` and does not preserve creation date.

Experiment based on https://video.stackexchange.com/a/24524[the next answer] (but without `-c copy` to actually recode the video):

----
ffmpeg.exe -i MVI_0059.MP4 -map_metadata 0 out-map-metadata.mp4
exiftool.exe out-map-metadata.mp4 > exif-ff-out-map-metadata.txt
----

* `exif-ff-out-map-metadata.txt` is a bit smaller than the previous, but contains actual creation date!
It still does not contain anything about camera or lens.

Finally, https://video.stackexchange.com/a/28599[this answer] uses `exiftool`:

----
cp out.mp4 out-copy.mp4
exiftool -TagsFromFile MVI_0059.MP4 "-all:all>all:all" out-copy.mp4
exiftool out-copy.mp4 > exif-ff-out-copy.txt
----

* The output is barely better, it contains also Camera make and model, but no lens info.

But with just a slight modification we can get what we want, sometimes less is more (we'll modify `out.mp4` directly):

----
exiftool -TagsFromFile MVI_0059.MP4 out.mp4
exiftool.exe out.mp4
----

* This output is not as rich as the original (134 items, original had 245), but everything important is there.

== Audio conversion

To OGG Q7 (`anything-to-ogg-44k1-q7.sh`):

----
#!/bin/sh

# ffmpeg installed as part of imagemagick or imagemagick.app (using chocolatey)
# this version also supports better libvorbis, unlike binary from ffmpeg web

# Usage with find: find . -iname \*.flac -exec anything-to-ogg-44k1-q7.sh {} \;

# filename must by in additional {} for protection of spaces
# -vn is no video (just in case of some cover image in flac file)
# -y to overwrite file
ffmpeg.exe -i "${1}" -ar 44100 -vn -codec:a libvorbis -qscale:a 7 -y "${1%.*}.ogg"
----

To MP3 for players that don't support OGG or FLAC.
This one is more sophisticated, it doesn't override original files and allows directory as the
last argument (`anything-to-mp3.sh`):

----
#!/bin/sh
# takes list of files to convert, can be ogg or any other format
# last param can be output dir (created if necessary, defaults to basedir of input file)
#
# ffmpeg installed as part of imagemagick or imagemagick.app (using chocolatey)
# this version also supports better libvorbis, unlike binary from ffmpeg web
#
# Usage with find: find . -name \*.flac -exec ./anything-to-mp3.sh {} \;
# filename must by in additional {} for protection of spaces
# -vn is no video (just in case of some cover image in flac file)
# -y to overwrite the output file (input file is not changed of course)
#
# Example:
# anything-to-mp3.sh /f/music/ABBA/1979\ Voulez-Vous/*.ogg "ABBA 1979 Voluez-Vous"
#
# Example for multiple albums with output directory per album:
# for DIR in /f/music/Beatles/19[67]*; do
#   OUT="Beatles - "`basename "$DIR"`; anything-to-mp3.sh "$DIR"/*.mp3 "$OUT"
# done

# finds last argument: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1853993/658826
for last; do true; done

if [ -d "$last" -o ! -f "$last" ]; then
  OUTDIR="$last"
  mkdir -p "$OUTDIR"
  echo "Output to: $OUTDIR"

  # Setting new arg list without the last arg (only files to convert are there now)
  set -- "${@:1:$(($#-1))}"
fi

while [ -n "$1" ]; do
  # if we get to the last param that is used as output dir, we can exit (not necessary after set above)
  #[ "$OUTDIR" = "$1" ] && exit

  OUT="${1%.*}.mp3"
  if [ -n "$OUTDIR" ]; then
    OUT="$OUTDIR/"`basename "$OUT"`
  fi
  if [ "${1}" = "${OUT}" ]; then
    echo "Input and output file is the same! Exiting..."
    exit
  fi

  # quality 4~165kbps, 5~130 (lower is better): https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/MP3
  # ffmpeg has its own quoting system, doesn't work well with single-quotes, so we redirect
  ffmpeg.exe -i pipe: -ar 44100 -vn -codec:a libmp3lame -qscale:a 4 -y "${OUT}" < "$1"

  shift
done
