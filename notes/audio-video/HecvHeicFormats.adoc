* Video and `ffmpeg`: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.265

== Testing video

With H.265 video file `MVI_3820_ff.mp4` of size 7163k and video bitrate of
7849 kb/s I tried to convert it with `ffmpeg` with `libx265` to roughly half the size:
----
ff -i MVI_3820_ff.mp4 -c:v libx265 -b:v 4000k out.mp4
----

But even with higher bitrates, paused image from the original was much sharper
(using Media Player Classic, MPC-HC).

* Was the problem with using H.264 source video with already low bitrate?
* Was it playback quality of MPC-HC for HICV? It indicated HVC1, while
`ffmpeg` indicates `hev1`, but it is the same thing according to
https://stackoverflow.com/a/32485240/658826[this answer].
* Can the problem be with source file decoding with `ffmpeg`?
* Is worse quality of paused image a feature of HICV?

More research required.
