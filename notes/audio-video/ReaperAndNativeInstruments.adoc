=== Midi velocity curve adjustment

For keyboards like Komplete Kontrol M32 it's handy to adjust velocity curve.
It can hardly fix the feeling and low responsiveness on the soft end, but it can help reach higher volume easier.

This can be done in many NI instruments directly, but that also changes the result
when keyboard with better sensitivity/feeling is used.
It is better to keep adjustments in a filter plugin that can be turned on and off.
For this we can use JS MIDI CC Mapper X which can be installed via ReaPack.

1. Insert the plugin before the instrument.
2. Click on the *Vel* function.
3. Enable the mapping so it shows *Enabled* - otherwise it shows *Disabled*.
4. Choose the type of the curve.
5. Choose the function parameter, the higher it is, the steeper or more extreme the curves are.
6. Choose the Min/Max value if needed.
7. Then click on the curve and it will display it in the pane on the left.
It will always adjust the shape based on the parameters after you click the shape.
8. Finally, save the preset.
