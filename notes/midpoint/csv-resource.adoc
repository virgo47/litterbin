= CSV resource how-to

Let's say we have a CSV resource with users we want to import called *HR*.
Our `hr.csv` file looks like this:

----
include::hr.csv[]
----

== Import working resource

Easiest thing to do is to import an existing resource object that worked before.
Most likely, the `connectorRef` needs to be changed unless the filter is used.
Some changes may be necessary if the schema is different.
It may not be practical to import then, but it can still be used for snippets.

== Troubleshooting

* Warning *Could not import account shadow...* with error *No object class found for the shadow*.
+
This indicates some stale Shadow in the repository, probably from the time when the resource was misconfigured.
