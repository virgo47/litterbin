Notes about imaginary "Java really 2" (less and less sure about that Java)


## Generic ideas or questions

### Language features

* No language-level serialization - Brian Goetz could go on about this forever
* Operator overloading for sure.
* "Code-literals"/references, not just class, but also methods, fields, anything. This can help with some
problems currently solved by reflection, meta-programming, things like JPA where you need to
generate metadata (now you'd have it) or anywhere you now use attribute paths as strings.
* Support for delegation:
	* What should `this` mean in the delegate?
	* Can I create stateless delegates that would completely cover behavior in superclass?
	* But what about the state? Can we define delegates that reach out for some properties?
	* Delegate can be convenient way how to "add" functionality regardless of is-a/has-a relationship.
	* Can delegate help with template method pattern? (If that pattern is even appropriate/needed.)
It seems it can, in this case we would create an object with the template method (how to create
new instances?) and give it delegate (or more delegates) with concrete implementation of template
method steps. In this case delegates work as subclasses in class-based language.
	* Is there a way how to let delegate call back the main object? Is it needed? E.g. calling
a method on this, if this means current object and delegate doesn't count as different object.
But is it the right thing to do? Shouldn't we distinguish between delegates and some mixin?
* Meta-data from annotation - imagine Querydsl doesn't need to generate anything and just use
existing entity. That would probably also require extension mechanism.
* Extension methods.
* Lambda, method reference (synergy with code-literals), ... generally Java 8 functional stuff.
* Pattern matching (Scala like, what has Haskell in addition to that?)
* How to treat null?
* var/val
* strongly typed with type inference
* Objects with identity vs Values, no primitives needed.
	* Should objects and values share the same operator?
	`==` should be "equal value", but should it be overridable for objects?
	I want to avoid chaos of `==` and `===` of JavaScript, on the other hand some agreed upon
	method like `equals` for object (defaults to `==`) would be OK.
	Actually Java isn't bad as it is, except for the lack of value types with support for `==`
	like for enum values.
* Numeric types: Offer old-school Int with overflow for low-level stuff, but otherwise prefer
safer version without overflow. Should it NaN or throw an exception? In Pragmatic Programmer they
consider NaN not good (fail early), which is probably better (although IEEE754 prescribes how to
use NaN, so for these types we have to obey).
* Annotations where any parameter can be marked as default (e.g. parameter with name "name" can
be default and used without explicit "name =").
* Method/function default parameters? I'd go for it (trailing).
* More control over package visibility (like sub-packages are not the same as outside packages).
* Modularity (what from Java and what from OSGi or something else).
* Object literals like JavaScript, that is just cool. Do we even need "schema" for these objects?
Sometimes it can be useful (framework, DTO, generation or WS, ...).
	* Object literal in JS is object creation on the spot, whatever its structure is. Sometimes
	we may want to conform to some structure. For that we need to predefine the structure. What
	syntax for that? That also implies types - simple and structured (classes?) as well.
* Reflection, including stack introspection, it can be super useful, e.g. [this
post](https://brewing.codes/2017/01/04/how-to-implement-string-interpolation-in-python/) towards
the end.
* Some form of metaprogramming ala Groovy?

### Language - questionable and/or radical

* Generators - how do ES6 function*/yield relate to Scala sequence comprehension? Resumable return
seems quite messy to me. Also see [Python vs Scala](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2137619/scala-equivalent-to-python-generators).
* [Crockford on ES6](http://bdadam.com/blog/video-douglas-crockford-about-the-new-good-parts.html):
what about classes? Do we really need/want them? He doesn't like generators (my feeling exactly).
* Crockford also mentions [DEC64](http://dec64.com/) - do we want it, and if do we need it as
built-in type.
* Desctructuring looks good, should work fine with tuples too.
* Is there a nice syntax for multiple ... parameters? This is not possible with Java, but how can
we make it nicer? Is collection literal enough? (Probably should be if it's short enough.)

### Concurrency

* Concurrency? Definitely not with every object being a monitor? Memory model?
* Thread attributes? Like Takipi is recommending setting names, but why not have richer map-like
API? It can still be cleared at start of the request. Is there other good implicit solution for
this? Thread-local vars are not the same, as we have to somehow reach them and they actuall can
leak memory easier than thread attributes (at least I think so).

### Runtime

* What runtime? No chance to make own VM... How to provide "Unsafe"-like things?
* Memory management? JVM-like? Go? With or without GC (like Rust)?
* Prefer memory collocation (value objects should help).

### Libraries

* Modern collection utils, mutable/immutable with literals - should literals be on language level?
can we make the lang so that it just flows even without built-in literals? (Operator overloads?)
* How would it implement regex matching without really building it into language. Again - operator
overload - can we start with some funky operator (like / or ~) that would use some predefined
utility function? Can these be some default extending methods? Can this be redefined/overriden
(e.g. using better regex library)?

### Tools

* Scripting capabilities => REPL, shell.
* In source documentation similar to Javadoc, but in more convenient markup - actually markdown.
Processing should be switchable anyway (ideally using some project meta-data facility) and
supported by IDEs. Default markdown format should be extensible.
* Built-in tools for formatting? Project meta-data definition (e.g. what kind of source-doc format
is used). 

### Resources

* Brian Goetz, [Move Deliberately and Donâ€™t Break Anything](https://youtu.be/K__bKr5mGXY)

## Why not Scala?

* Functionally very good already.
* Meta/code-literals not available(?)
