== Video setup

Section: *Setting | Output | Recording*

Recording format: *mkv* - while not easily digested, it's safe when recording crashes.
It is easy to copy streams to MP4 or other containers later using `ffmpeg`.

Audio Track: select first three.

We will use first for the mixed audio, second for the desktop audio only and third for the microphone.

Encoder: *x264* - this one supports rate control via *CRF* which we want to use.
No rescaling needed - we mostly go for 1080p video.

Rate control *CRF* set to *21* and CPU Usage Preset *veryfast*.
This seems to work well enough, the final video can have wide range of bitrates, e.g. UT2004 was around 15Mbps,
but slower game or recording application tutorials can have much lower bitrates.
With lower CRF values (higher quality) and slower CPU presets the video could have jitter,
but this may also depend on background processes.
