= Keytool and certificates

To see the details of a certificate:

----
keytool -keystore jssecacerts -storepass changeit -list -v -alias <cert-alias>
----

To print it in RFC style replace `-v` with `-rfc`.

More about this and also how to extract public key from the certificate:

== Working with default `cacerts`

This file is located:

* under `jre/lib/security` for JDK 8 and lower,
* under `lib/security` for JDK 9+ and all recent JREs.

In JDK 9 and later you don't have to use `-keystore <path-to-it>/cacerts` but you can use
simple `-cacerts` instead - default `cacerts` file will be used automatically.
This can be used with many commands (`-delete`, `-list`, â€¦) but not all (e.g. `-importkystore`).

See link:update-default-cacert-store.sh[this script].

== Updating cacert 2022

After adding fresh JDK 17, Maven first failed on being too old to handle it, so I upgraded to 3.8 (added new Maven).
Then it failed with:

----
...PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target -> [Help 1]
----

To fix this I used this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/53886108/658826

If CA key is used, skip step 2 and use `mycompany-ca.crt` in `-file` parameter.
Step 2 uses server certificate which can likely change quite often, root certificate is always preferred.

[NOTE]
Root certificate may be a corporate one or not, depending on the server.
If the server is intranet-only, it likely uses a corporate CA.
If it is a public server, then one of public CAs is likely used (e.g. Let's Encrypt).
It can also be a self-signed certificate - in that case, download it from the server (step 2).

As root:

. I went to my new favourite JDK:
+
----
cd /usr/lib/jvm/zulu17.28.13-ca-jdk17.0.0-linux_x64
----

. Download the certificate as PEM file using keytool:
+
----
bin/keytool  -printcert -rfc -sslserver nexus.mycompany.com > ~/nexus_mycompany_com.pem
----

. Install it to `cacert` file:
+
----
find -iname cacerts # printed ./lib/security/cacerts
bin/keytool -importcert -file ~/mycompany-ca.crt -alias mycompany-ca -keystore lib/security/cacerts
# OR for server cert
#bin/keytool -importcert -file ~/nexus_mycompany_com.pem -alias nexus-server -keystore lib/security/cacerts
----

Next Maven run was the happy one.

TODO: What happens when server certificate is renewed?
The process must be repeated (how to remove old cert?) I guess.
It's better to use root certificate - this may be corporate or other public root CA.
