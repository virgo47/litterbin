= Presentation Tools

* https://obsproject.com/[OBS] for screen recording (or streaming).

* IntelliJ IDEA plugin *Presentation Assistant* to show tooltips with keyboard shortcuts.
Adjust settings in *File | Settings | Appearance & Behavior | Presentation Assistant*,
e.g. show your own keymap as main and Windows with `by default` description
(it's not possible to show Windows as main and Mac as alternative).
`Alt+Shift+D` to toggle - action is called *Descriptions of Actions*.

* Use https://sites.google.com/view/catnip5/mouse-highlight[Mouse Highlight].
Set 30/80 + yellow (`ffff00`) for mouse and 20/127/300 + green (`80ff80`) for click.
